multiply = num1 * num2

//that will multiply the variables num1 and num2 whose results will equal "62".


random = Math.floor(Math.random(num > 0)

//that will generate a random integer greater than 0.


mod = num % 2 =4

//set to an equation whose remainder is equal to "4".


max = 

//that will return "20" as the highest number in the set.
